Make server use the same ScoreboardScript for storing the scoreboard.

Fix the vertical movement. If we had initial air velocity positive going upwards then
even if all of the sudden we get isGrounded true we should still continue our 
movement up.

On respawn reset ammo back to initial value

Player join while another one is dead corner case

Turning around (horizontal) in idle is just rotating the player mesh
(no animation going on)

Random currently dependent on entire project (everything that uses random depends
on one another). That means if we shoot 10 projectiles that uses random to change
direction a tiny bit, it will influence the random from anything else. Fix this.

Meele movement is faster hence animation should be faster.
