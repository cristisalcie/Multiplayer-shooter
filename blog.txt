29.06.2021 - Understood raycasting, created new test movement using unity's character controller

30.06.2021 - Integrated new movement into project, implemented faster movement speed and double jump while using meele and single jump when using other weapons, understood how to find all connected players (network identities), finally understood Delegates and that EventHandlers and Actions are implemented over Delegates hence they are Delegates

01.07.2021 - Separated code into function in canvasInGameHUD, created scoreboard template with fields ready to be hooked up to players, learned how to extend NetworkManager and implemented disconnect message sending on chat

09.07.2021 - Implemented first working scoreboard

10.07.2021 - Improved scoreboard but can do better
10.07.2021 - I tried to sync kills and deaths with a hook function that would get called on every player when kills or deaths change value and update an internal playerScript scoreboard player list.
When a player would join they create a new empty list with capacity maxConnections and call a command to server (CmdSetupPlayer) to insert playerName into every single connected client by using ClientRpc function
	RpcInsertIntoScoreboard(string _playerName).
When a player disconnects, in GameNetworkManager
	OnServerDisconnect(NetworkConnection conn)
we would call a clientRPC
	_dcPlayerScript.RpcRemoveFromScoreboard(string _playerName)
to tell every connected client to remove that player from their scoreboard.
The problem i encountered and couldn't solve is that when from inside a [Command] tagged function call a ClientRpc (for example RpcUpdateScoreboard()) i would get that the scoreboardPlayerList is null error.

12.07.2021 - Continued research, started playing around with animation state machine1
12.07.2021 - Implemented working test animation (running, crouching, idle) 
Failed converting rig from generic to humanoid without ruining the animation
13.07.2021 - Concluded it is not easy to convert generic rig and animations to humanoid without losing animation precision. Hence i stick to generic and YBot character.
14.07.2021 - 15.07.2021 - Made separate generic animations and blend trees for aiming up and down in a test scene
15.07.2021 - 18.07.2021 - Completed animations by introducing aiming on vertical axis (up and down) in test scene, added fps counter, fixed ground detection in test scene
